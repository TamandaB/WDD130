      <p>Dance - Malawi holds a lot of dances that are attached to tradition and one of the very famous ones is Gulewamkulu Traditional Dance...
        The Gulewamkulu Traditional Dance is a traditional dance performed by the Chewa people of Malawi, and Zambia.The Chewa ancestors started the dance to communicate with the souls of their deceased, their ancestors, and gods.
        The dance was performed to honor the spirits and satisfying them so that they could protect and guide those performing the dance as they asked for blessings from them. It served as a way for Chewa people to show their cultural principles, faith as well as traditional practices which include their bond with the environment and the metaphysical.
